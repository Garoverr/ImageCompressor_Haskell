__ImageCompressor__ in __Haskell__ based on __K-Means algorithm__.

__compressor.py__ in __Python__ to transfrom png/jpg files in the ImageCompressor format.

__App.js__ in __JavaScript__ for the graphical interface.

## Description:


## Usage:

After cloning the repository, you can use the haskell imageCompressor by different ways:
- One with a graphical interface, made with `react.js`.
- One is in terminal with a python script to give a `.png` or `.jpg` file and output a new compressed image.
- One is in terminal, in the Epitech way, you give a ppm file and it will order the pixels by using the k-means algorithm.

__It's the same haskell program for all of them.__

If it's not already made:  `chmod +x script.sh`

It will build the stack project and use the Makefile. It will also check the npm installation.

The script will start a server on port 5000 and start the react web site on port 3000: `./script.sh`

You will normaly be redirected in website on port 3000. If not, go on it by hand.`http://localhost:3000`

There you can browse a `.png` or `.jpg` file and play with the cursors. The number of clusters is the number of colors you will have on your compressed picture. The degree is the intensity of the research.
